## Coming Soon

A full port of [SlackTextViewController](https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController) to Swift.

## Huh?

SlackTextViewController doesn't have a lot of activity or [releases](https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController/releases) these days, but it's such a useful library and a solid alternative to other great messaging libraries it would be sad to see it die a silent death.

## Why?

For some apps simplicity is best and utilizing a UITableView or UICollectionView for messaging is perfect but there needs to be a little more provided to better utilize them as messaging apps. That's where MessengerKit comes in. It's simply a UITableViewController, or UICollectionViewController, and you have full control over the experience, but with a little splash of magic sauce on top to help craft the ideal messaging feature.

## When?

The roadmap is tentatively as such:

-  [ ] As reasonable as possible port the Obj-C version over to Swift in a 1:1 fashion so it can be drop in ready

- [ ] Clean up - utilize Swift specific features to overhaul the internals and spec out if there would be any API changes. Ideally they are light.

- [ ] Move on - add in new features!
